  <p>Hello! My name is Siyanda Mpofu and I am from Gauteng, South Africa. I enjoy participating in sports and coding.The types of sports i enjoy the most is Football and Rugby. I play Striker as a footballer and I play Flyhalf as a rugby player. I am a identical twin to a boy. I come from a family of three boys. I finished high school in 2023 graduating with a Bachelor and I finished a year early with only 17 years. What made me choose coding and web Fundamentals is because, i love everything about AI and i know that there is a lot of things a can do too help the world become a better place. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ Of Latter-day in South Africa, Gauteng, Midrand branch. I hope many more people join the church so that they get to know about the third testimony of our Heavenly Father. </p>
